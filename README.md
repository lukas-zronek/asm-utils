asm-utils is a small collection of selected Unix utilities implemented in 32-bit x86 assembly language (AT&T syntax) for FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD (>= 5.5), macOS (<= Mojave 10.14) and GNU/Linux.

The project was started for educational purposes to learn x86 assembly programming on Unix-like operating systems.
